      "    \n",
      "    **pandas** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data\n",
      "    structures designed to make working with \"relational\" or \"labeled\" data both\n",
      "    easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\n",
      "    doing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\n",
      "    the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data\n",
      "    analysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on\n",
      "    its way toward this goal.\n",

      "      - Easy handling of missing data in floating point as well as non-floating\n",
      "        point data.\n",
      "      - Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and\n",
      "        higher dimensional objects\n",
      "      - Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned\n",
      "        to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let\n",
      "        `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically align the data for you in\n",
      "        computations.\n",
      "      - Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine\n",
      "        operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data.\n",
      "      - Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python\n",
      "        and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects.\n",
      "      - Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large\n",
      "        data sets.\n",
      "      - Intuitive merging and joining data sets.\n",
      "      - Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets.\n",
      "      - Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick).\n",
      "      - Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited),\n",
      "        Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data from the ultrafast HDF5\n",

      "    In Python, objects can declare their textual representation using the\n",
      "    `__repr__` method. IPython expands on this idea and allows objects to declare\n",
      "    other, rich representations including:\n",
      "    \n",
      "      - HTML\n",
      "      - JSON\n",
      "      - PNG\n",

      "    \n",

      "    handled by IPython's display system.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The main idea of the first approach is that you have to implement special\n",
      "    display methods when you define your class, one for each representation you\n",
      "    want to use. Here is a list of the names of the special methods and the\n",
      "    values they must return:\n",
      "    \n",
      "      - `_repr_html_`: return raw HTML as a string, or a tuple (see below).\n",
      "      - `_repr_json_`: return a JSONable dict, or a tuple (see below).\n",
      "      - `_repr_jpeg_`: return raw JPEG data, or a tuple (see below).\n",
      "      - `_repr_png_`: return raw PNG data, or a tuple (see below).\n",
      "      - `_repr_svg_`: return raw SVG data as a string, or a tuple (see below).\n",
      "      - `_repr_latex_`: return LaTeX commands in a string surrounded by \"$\",\n",
      "                        or a tuple (see below).\n",
      "      - `_repr_mimebundle_`: return a full mimebundle containing the mapping\n",

      "                             Use this for any mime-type not listed above.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The above functions may also return the object's metadata alonside the\n",

      "    containing the data and metadata, in that order.  If there is no metadata\n",
      "    available, then the functions will return the data only.\n",
      "    \n",

      " |  the view functions, the URL rules, template configuration and much more.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  The name of the package is used to resolve resources from inside the\n",

      " |  \n",
      " |  For more information about resource loading, see :func:`open_resource`.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  Usually you create a :class:`Flask` instance in your main module or\n",
      " |  in the :file:`__init__.py` file of your package like this::\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |      from flask import Flask\n",

      " |      on the filesystem, can be used by extensions to improve debugging\n",
      " |      information and a lot more.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |      So it's important what you provide there.  If you are using a single\n",
      " |      module, `__name__` is always the correct value.  If you however are\n",
      " |      using a package, it's usually recommended to hardcode the name of\n",
      " |      your package there.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |      For example if your application is defined in :file:`yourapplication/app.py`\n",
      " |      you should create it with one of the two versions below::\n",

      " |      Why is that?  The application will work even with `__name__`, thanks\n",
      " |      to how resources are looked up.  However it will make debugging more\n",
      " |      painful.  Certain extensions can make assumptions based on the\n",
      " |      import name of your application.  For example the Flask-SQLAlchemy\n",
      " |      extension will look for the code in your application that triggered\n",

      " |      up, that debugging information is lost.  (For example it would only\n",
